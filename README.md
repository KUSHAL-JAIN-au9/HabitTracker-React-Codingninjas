# HabitTracker-React-Codingninjas

This repository contains a React project bootstrapped with Vite, a fast and lightweight build tool for modern web development.

## Project Setup

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KUSHAL-JAIN-au9/HabitTracker-React-Codingninjas.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd HabitTracker-React-Codingninjas
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will launch the development server and open the application in your default browser. The server will automatically reload the page whenever you make changes to the source code.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
vite-react-project/
  |- public/
  |   |- index.html
  |
  |- src/
  |   |- components/
  |   |   |- App.js
  |   |
  |   |- styles/
  |   |   |- index.css
  |   |
  |   |- index.js
  |
  |- .gitignore
  |- package.json
  |- README.md
```

- The `public` directory contains the main `index.html` file, which serves as the entry point for the application.

- The `src` directory contains the React components, styles, and the main `index.js` file.

- The `components` directory houses the reusable React components used in the application. You can modify and create new components in this directory.
- The `pages` directory houses the main page design containing required reusable component .

- The `styles` directory contains the CSS stylesheets for the application. The `index.css` file serves as the main stylesheet and can be updated as needed.

- The `index.js` file is the entry point for the React application. You can modify this file to add or remove components and configure routing, if necessary.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server and opens the application in your default browser.

- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production. The optimized and minified files will be generated in the `dist` directory.
